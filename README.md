# WebGuard
This project is a simple, lightweight Python script designed to block specific websites on a browser locally. It modifies system files to restrict access to certain URLs, ensuring that the selected sites are inaccessible from the user's machine. Ideal for productivity, parental control, or self-imposed web limitations.
